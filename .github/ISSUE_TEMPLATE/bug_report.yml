        Please answer the following questions:

        1. **What is happening?** (Describe the actual behavior)

        2. **When/How does it occur?** (After restart, at specific times, with specific devices, ...)

        3. **What did you expect?** (Describe the expected behavior)

        4. **What have you tried?** (Restart, reload, re-pairing, ...)

        NO logs here!

        💡 **Tip:** For device-related issues (missing entities, wrong values, strange behavior), screenshots are much more helpful than long text descriptions! Show us what you see in Home Assistant or the CCU.
