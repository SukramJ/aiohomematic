# This workflow publishes the main AioHomematic package to PyPI when a GitHub Release is published,
# and also creates a separate "support-vX.Y.Z" release that contains only the aiohomematic_support
# folder as a ZIP PLUS an independently built support wheel/sdist (aiohomematic-support).
#
# Prereqs/assumptions:
# - Root pyproject.toml excludes aiohomematic_support from prod builds (wheel/sdist).
# - A minimal packaging setup exists at aiohomematic_support/{__init__.py, pyproject.toml}.
# - Trusted Publishing to PyPI is configured for this repository.
#
# Result:
# - Main Release tag: vX.Y.Z  -> uploads to PyPI.
# - Support Release tag: support-vX.Y.Z -> attaches:
#       * aiohomematic_support-vX.Y.Z.zip
#       * aiohomematic_support-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
#       * aiohomematic_support-<version>.tar.gz
