# Contributing to hahomematic

If there is anything you want to see in hahomematic (features, bugfixes etc.), you can fork this repository, make your changes and then create a pull request (against the devel-branch). Just like with most of the other repositories here.

Please restrict your changes to the actual code within the hahomematic-folder. The repository-maintainers are keeping track of changes and will updated the changelog and setup.py.

If you can't do it yourself, feel free to create an issue and we'll have a look at it.
