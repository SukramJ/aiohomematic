# Short description of calculated sensors

## Operating Voltage Level

requires: operating voltage, max voltage(battery voltage\*qty), min voltage (low bat limit default)

Calculated sensor to define the left over capacity within the usable voltage range.

## Climate sensors

### Apparent Temperature (Feels like)

requires: temperature, humidity, wind speed

Calculated sensor that displays a perceived temperature using temperature, humidity and wind speed.

### Dew Point

requires: temperature, humidity

The temperature, with constant pressure and water-vapour content, to which air must be cooled for saturation to occur.

### Frost Point

requires: temperature, humidity

The temperature to which a sample of air must be cooled, at constant pressure and humidity, to reach saturation with respect to ice.

### Vapor Concentration (Absolute Humidity)

requires: temperature, humidity

The vapor concentration or absolute humidity of a mixture of water vapor and dry air is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor Mw to the volume V occupied by the mixture.

Dv = Mw / V expressed in g/m3
